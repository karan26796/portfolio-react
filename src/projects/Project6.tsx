        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>Continuous Rewards</strong> project was conceptualized to introduce a flexible, day-to-day recognition system within Keka to
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bring companies' informal recognition practices into a structured system</li>
          <li>Complement existing praise features with tangible rewards</li>
          <li>Initiate an employee recognition system from the company's end</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The existing award programs in Keka catered to long term reward strategies but short term recognition was lacking.</h4>

        <h6>Components</h6>
        <h3>Setting up the program</h3>
        <p>
          The continuous rewards program consists of three main components: </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>General Settings</strong> : To set up the overall framework and guidelines for the rewards program.</li>
          <li><strong>Milestone Rewards</strong> : To automate celebrations for significant employee milestones.</li>
          <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Rewards</strong> : To facilitate employee recognition through peer interactions.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h6>Part I</h6>
        <h3>Flexible Configuration System</h3>
        <p>
          Companies ran informal day-to-day reward programs already, using Slack bots, or WhatsApp. Some called the rewards <strong> donuts</strong>, some <strong>cookies</strong>. Hence we added a way for them to customize this in the system.<br /><br />
          The configuration system also allows HR admins to account for currency coversion, integrate a marketplace etc.
        </p>
        <blockquote>üç© A company's policy was to send a donut box to the employees who received most number of donuts on Slack.</blockquote>
