Designing a VR tool for web

The first version of every VR app is to get stakeholder buy in, set the vision and then move on to apps like Unity. To solve for this use case we designed a VR design tool for web in that can help create a storyboard for VR apps which can align a team's vision before moving on to development.

While there a lot of tools that help with building 2d apps and experiences, there aren't many when it comes to designing for VR apps.

Stakeholder buy in is a crucial step in any development project before moving into execution. 

Storyboards are a great way to set the correct vision before moving forward and saves resources like time and effort.

While there are a lot of storyboarding tools available for 2d apps, 3D, especially VR apps don't have a lot of precedents.

To solve this problem, we made a VR tool for the web and the headset that helps teams set the tone for the project via storyboarding in the 3d space. The first
phase was to be able to add and edit frames seemlessly.

There was a way to see the storyboard as a whole but once zoomed into a frame there was no way to see what came before and after.

Iterations
See the frames from menu above
Problems no consistency in view and add options

Expand floating bar to reveal the frames
Problems Animation was too heavy, and didn't give an option to switch before expanding

Nudge bar at the bottom
Solved for discoverability and gave an easy option to move between frames without expanding the entire element

I designed an interaction to see all the frames which is non intrusive and yet gives an overview.

Since storyboards move linearly and only have incremental changes between frames, I gave an option to either create an empty frame or duplicate the current frame to slightly move items within.
