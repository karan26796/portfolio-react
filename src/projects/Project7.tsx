        <h6>The Problem</h6>
        <h3> Falling Engagement on the Wall</h3>
        <p>
          Engagement on Keka wall was dropping ‚Äî wishes, praise, and even posts were
          being used less. Since wishes occupied a prominent space, we decided to
          use them as the anchor to revive overall engagement.
        </p>

        <h4>
         ‚ùå Issues with the current widget:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Unclear entry point to post a wish</li>
          <li>Same experience for the wisher and receiver</li>
          <li>No way to follow up on wishes post the special day</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h6>Interaction design</h6>
        <h3>ü§î Unclear & Transactional Experience</h3>
        <p>
          The existing wish flow wasn‚Äôt intuitive. Employees weren‚Äôt sure how to
          send a wish, and for receivers, the experience felt transactional
          rather than personal.

        <h6>First Experiment</h6>
        <h3>üü° Bigger Cards, Prominent Faces</h3>
        <p>
          We tried highlighting employees by enlarging their card and photo. While
          it improved discoverability, it caused two issues:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If one person‚Äôs card became bigger, others had to be hidden.</li>
          <li>
            Many employees didn‚Äôt have profile pictures, so the design often
            looked empty.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúBigger isn‚Äôt always better‚Äîvisibility for one shouldn‚Äôt come at the
          cost of others.‚Äù

        <h6>Second Experiment</h6>
        <h3>üü° A Dedicated Wall of Wishes</h3>
        <p>
          We also explored giving each employee their own dedicated ‚Äúwall of
          wishes.‚Äù It looked special but disconnected the experience from the
          main wall widget. 
          <br/><br/>
          The board could look empty if someone's birthday fell on a weekend.

        <h6>The Breakthrough</h6>
        <h3>üí° A Clear Wish CTA</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of overcomplicating, we added a simple, clear <b>Wish CTA</b>{" "}
          below every name. This created a frictionless entry point for sending
          wishes, without hiding anyone else.
        </p>

          ‚ÄúThe CTA was a common thread in all the previous iterations.‚Äù

      <section>
        <h2>ü•≥ Making the Day Feel Special</h2>
        <p>
          For employees on their special day, we added a <b>banner</b> that
          aggregated all wishes into a single, visually appealing card. This:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allowed employees to revisit wishes even days later.</li>
          <li>Made the experience feel more personal and celebratory.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>üéâ Delight Through Micro-Interactions</h2>
        <p>
          To make wishes more fun, we added a simple confetti animation when
          someone posted a wish. This small delight reinforced the feeling of
          celebration.

        <h2>üìà Impact: 3x Adoption, 5x Engagement</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Average wishes per employee jumped from <b>2 to 8</b>.</li>
          <li>Adoption grew <b>3x</b> from 5k to 15k users a week.</li>
          <li>
            Engagement improved <b>5x</b>, with 31k employees sending wishes to
            116k colleagues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other features on the wall, like posts and praise, also saw a boost in
            usage.
