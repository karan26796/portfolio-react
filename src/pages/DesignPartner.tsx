        Hey, Karan here. I'm a digital product designer, and a AI powered react dev. I help 
        <br />
        <br />
        I started off as an Android Developer but soon moved to UX Design. Since
        then I've had a lot of fun designing digital products for studios &
        product companies.
        <br />
        <br />
        The first company I joined as a designer got shut during the pandemic.
        Due to a lot of free time, I started learning Figma during the pandemic
        & thought - why not share what I know with others?
        <br />
        <br />
        Since then, I've taught 10k+ people through my design workshops &
        Youtube tutorials.
