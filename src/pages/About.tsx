    <h2>Hello, Karan here</h2>
    <h5>Hello, it's me, Karan. I'm a digital product designer, code learner, electronics prototyper, amateur photo clicker, & traveller.
When I'm not saving the world with design, I watch standup comedy, travel the country, photograph landscapes, play lawn tennis, and learn to code. One at a time.

I started off as an Android Developer but soon moved to UX Design. Since then I've had a lot of fun designing digital products for studios & product companies.

The first company I joined as a designer got shut during the pandemic. Due to a lot of free time, I started learning Figma during the pandemic & thought - why not share what I know with others?

Since then, I've taught 10k+ people through my design workshops & Youtube tutorials.</h5>
