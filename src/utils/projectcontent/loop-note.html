			<div class="item-summary long">
				<h4 style="margin-top:0">Outcome</h4>

			<!-- <h2>Context</h2>

			<p>During our conversations with researchers, designers, marketers, and company CXOs we realized they took
				unstructured and structured notes. But all of them faced challenges while matching/collating the notes
			with interview transcript.</p> -->

			<!-- <h4>Testing unstructured and stuctured note taking designs</h4> -->
			<h4>What problems are we addressing?</h4>
			<h3>Revisiting an interview is one of the most painful parts of the research. It's similar to conducting the
				interview again, but with the additional effort of tagging and
				attaching notes to the transcript.
			</h3>

			<h4>Prototype testing our hypotheses</h4>
			<p>We designed and usability tested a prototype that the users could interact with while we conducted a
				mock interview (interviewception). </p><br>
			<p> <span>Giving the users a prototype to interact with gave us insights into the actions they can and can't
					perform during an interview.</span> <br><br>We made the prototype on Protopie to make it work like
				the dev
				version to get accurate usability data.</p>

			<h4>Design changes based on usability testing</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Removed the emojis as they could not be interacted with during the call.</li>
				<li>Added a bookmark feature which could be accessed using the "//" shortcut. This reduces the number of
					decisions a person
					makes during the call
				</li>
			</ul><br>
			<h3>People didn't expect the note-taking space to look like a chat, so we changed it into a more open
				space that makes the experience similar to a document.</h3>

		<!-- <div class="container-home padding-blog">

			<h4>What we learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>We assumed people would engage with the emojis the most, but those were the least used during a
					call. This pointed towards the fact that they wanted the note-taking doc to be in the backend, not
					front-end,
					during a call.</li>
				<li>Familiarity with the interface was the most important factor in getting a hang of the screen. This
					pointed towards the fact that when people wanted an experience to a Google or Notion doc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>To add structure to user calls, we ran another experiment in which we introduced a Question Script to
				the live notetaking experience.</h3>

		<div class="container-home padding-blog" style="margin-top:6em">

			<h4>Structured Note-taking format</h4>
			<h3>We observed researchers were using a template to take notes during research calls.</h3>

			<p>Below are some examples of the templates used</p>
		</div>

		<div class="img-container"><img src="./images-loop-note/task-1.png" class="img-blog">

			<h4>Iterating and testing a question script</h4>
			<h3>We iterated on top of previous designs and added sections to the note-taking view and tested with the
				users.</h3>

			<h4>Final Design</h4>
			<p><span>Based on usability testing, we decided to remove the navigation from the question script as users
					didn't
					face issues with traversing the script.</span><br><br></p>
			<h3>There was no need for a persistent list since they moved progressively between questions.</h3>

			<h4>What I learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Users liked the idea of unstructured notes since it gave a way to take notes that didn't fit in any
					question</li>
				<li>Users needed simple ways to capture their thoughts without having to remember a lot of shortcuts
				</li>
			</ul>
