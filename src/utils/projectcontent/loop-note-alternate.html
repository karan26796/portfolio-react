            <p><span>To make it easier for teams to get the most out of research calls and projects,

            <h4>First cut for Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>I created a prototype in Protopie to mock how people will take notes in Looppanel.</p>

            <h4>What didn't work</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The users weren't able to use the shortcuts or the controls in the interface.</li>
                <li>The interface looked like a chat window which the users couldn't connect with.</li>

            <h4>Second iteration for Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>I removed the shortcuts and added some instructions for people to understand the note taking screen</p>

            <h4>What didn't work</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The interface wasn't suited for a split screen use.</li>
                <li>People didn't use the bookmarking feature a lot.</li>

            <h4>Third iteration for Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>Since a lot of people during our research used Notion and Google Docs, I tried making the interface as

            <h4>What didn't work</h4>
            <ul>

            <h4>Fourth iteration for Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>To higlight who's taken the note, I added the names of note takers in different colors</p>

            <h4>What didn't work</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The different colors for note takers created distraction during note taking.</li>
                <li>The name of note takers takes up a lot of space without adding much to the interface</li>

                <li>Muted the name and time stamp colors to bring focus on the note.</li>
                <li>Removed the emojis as they could not be interacted with during the call.</li>
                <li>Added a bookmark feature which could be accessed using the "//" shortcut. This reduces the number of
                    decisions a person
                    makes during the call

            <h3>People didn't expect the note-taking space to look like a chat, so we changed it into a more open

			<h4>What we learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>We assumed people would engage with the emojis the most, but those were the least used during a
					call. This pointed towards the fact that they wanted the note-taking doc to be in the backend, not
					front-end,
					during a call.</li>
				<li>Familiarity with the interface was the most important factor in getting a hang of the screen. This
					pointed towards the fact that when people wanted an experience to a Google or Notion doc.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>To add structure to user calls, we ran another experiment in which we introduced a Question Script to
				the live notetaking experience.</h3>
