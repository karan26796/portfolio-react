## Why did the project exist?

**We introduced award programs in Keka HR as a means to run award campaigns in companies that recognize their employees.**

While Keka HR had award campaigns for recognizing employees every few months, there was no way for the company & other employees to recognize their peers on a day-to-day basis. This project addressed that gap.

This also gave Keka an opportunity to enter collaborations with rewards redemption platforms like XOXO Day, Qwikcilver etc. The introduction of this feature strengthened Keka's position in the market, especially when entering the US market.

## Project Components

**We divided the program into two parts**

The Keka platform already highlights people's personal milestones like birthdays, work anniversaries, and first days. Another feature, *Praises on Keka Wall*, allows employees to appreciate their peers—one of the most used features.

## User Personas

**While designing for Keka's HR platform, there are 3 types of users:**

- **Program Admin/HR**: Sets up the program, customizes it, tracks budgets.
- **Employees**: Engage with the system via familiar touch points like praises.
- **Finance Head**: Needs dashboards to forecast spending and track utilization.

## Problems the Product Solved

**HRs:**
- Lack of a structured system to foster appreciation
- Poor participation in existing efforts
- Difficult to scale recognition org-wide

**Employees:**
- Lack of appreciation in key moments
- No easy way to praise peers

**Finance Heads:**
- No budget clarity across multiple programs
- Manual tracking of expenses

**Managers:**
- No reward mechanism without approvals
- Performance reviews lacked social validation

## Design Process

**Stakeholder collaboration and early customer feedback**

We surveyed Keka clients to understand reward systems. Based on insights:

- Companies used unique reward names → we added customization
- Many used 3rd-party reward platforms → we enabled integrations
- Points needed to be role-based → we added hierarchy-based allocation
- Physical gifts were deprioritized due to complexity
